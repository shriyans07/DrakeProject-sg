# DrakeProject-sg
I built a basic website about the Canadian rapper, Drake.
The contents of this website include a Home page, an About Page, and a Store Page. 
In the Home Page, you are able to purchase the newest Drake album, "Her Loss", and listen to the album on Spotify. As well, you can purchase tickets for his 2023 tours. 
In the About Page, a biography of Drake is provided. Lastly, in the Store page, you are able to "purchase" four different Drake albums, as well as merch, but it is a
simulated version of purchasing items, and you can not receive any of these items.
In each page, a header is available at the top, which allows you to navigate within the pages. At the bottom of each page, there is a footer that provides Drakes
YouTube account, Spotify account, and Facebook account.
