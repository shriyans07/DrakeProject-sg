            <p class="about-p">Drake is now known for his fire albums, but did you know that he has a whole list of talented musicians in his family? Aubrey Drake Graham was born on Octover 24, 1986, in Toronto, Canada. His father, Dennis Graham, was a drummer for one of the legendary rock 'n' roll star himself, Jerry Lee Lewis. Uncle Larry Graham, played bass for The Family Stone, and Sly. His mother, Sandi Graham also hails from a musically talented family. For instance, his gradmother babysat Aretha Franklin. Despite his somewhat "spicy" music, Drake does come from a strong religious background. His mother was a white Canadian Jew and his father was an African American Catholic. Do you know which identity Drake fits in with more? You guessed it, Drake said, "At the end of the day, I consider myself a Black man because I'm more immersed in Black culture than any other." Despite this however, when Drake was five years old, his parents split up and young Drake was raised by his mother in the posh mainly Jewish neighborhood of Forest Hill in Toronto. He attended a Jewish day school, and at age thirteen had a Bar Mitzvah. However, due to his secondary school being an all-white institution, Drake recalls feeling isolated. But Drake is Drake, and recalled that "being different from everyone else just made me a lot stronger."</p>
